Rules for contributing:

1) Repos submitted must be properly organized by "dominant" license.

For instance, a public domain library such as myLittlez80 that includes GPL'd testfiles

must be in the GPL folder, because it has GPL things in it. The code may not be GPL, but

the repository as a whole is.

2) Use submodules `git submodule add https://github.com/C-Chads/my-repository.git` for large projects. 

	put them in the correct folder too, not the root.

3) Fork projects into C-Chads before adding them as sub-modules

4) Implement "make all" and "make clean" if relevant for your project.

5) Single-file or extremely small programs may be put in the repository raw.

6) Don't change another user's files without permission. Duplicate them if you need your own version.

7) Ask Gek (me) before including big stuff into the repo (over 100 megs).

8) Nothing illegal.

9) Be an adult.
