### Programs are organized by their license
### LICENSE files in directories cover the licenses for those files.
Building:
All makefile-maintainer approved programs are automatically built by doing
"make -B" in the top level of the repository.

Programs and libraries with unusual build dependencies will not build by default.

Programs that do not build by default are listed when you invoke make -B

At a minimum to build this library you will need:
* the gnu compiler collection, suggested version 8 or later.
* rm and cd commands in your shell
* gnu make (to use the build system)

These programs were written (or used) by the C Chads discord server.
### Free software is freedom!
